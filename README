I spoke with Professor Rene in his office hours during the begining of my project about how to breakdown the project
as well as how I would grid the levels and use arrays.

I used ChatGPT to bug fix so much and just to learn about how rand() works and 
the streambuf* since I am not super familiar with that. Most of my conversation was just inputting my code or and
error I got in terminal and asking why/what was wrong.

As mentioned in my comments, I got help from Kaye Galang with the OutFile starting process instead of using
ofstream outFs >>, to write out everything my program was doing.

I also got a little bit of help from Kalin Richardson when it came to placing Mario into the level
in Levels method DisplayLevel. I was making it a lot more complicated and it ultimately saved my project.
